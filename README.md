# EE1103_Assignment10_ShortestPathAlgorithms
## Doubts to ask to Sir in the next class:
1. We are expected to only use dijkstra for prob 2 right?
2. What is the expected output? 
    1. do you want us to consider each node as starting node and write 6 answers? if no, then which node to consider as starting node?
    2. are we supposed to calculate the shortest path to every node in each case? if no, then what is the ending node?
3. Anything else we need to include in the result? should we explain the process step by step?
